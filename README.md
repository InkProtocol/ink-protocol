Ink Protocol is implemented on Ethereum as a Smart Contract and includes an ERC20-compatible utility token, called `XNK`, which is used for payments. `XNK` is a general purpose cryptocurrency that is:

- Fixed supply (500,000,000 `XNK`)
- Fractionally divisible
- Non-inflationary
- Fungible and transferable

##### Smart Contract features

Ink Protocol solves some of the most common and difficult issues with buying and selling on a P2P marketplace through the following features:

- Decentralized feedback
- Decentralized reputation
- Decentralized escrow with third party dispute resolution
- [Mediation](https://github.com/InkProtocol/ink-protocol/wiki/Mediation) and Transaction Fees
- [Linked Addresses](https://github.com/InkProtocol/ink-protocol/wiki/Linked-Addresses)
- [Owners](https://github.com/InkProtocol/ink-protocol/wiki/Owners)

## Rinkeby Test Network

Ink Protocol is deployed to the Rinkby Test Network. You may test your interactions with the protocol there and even request free test `XNK` from the contract.
